# A little bit about myself..

Hi there! My name is Alex Beams and I am a Computer Science student and a web developer. I started my programmer journey in AP Computer Science where we learned fundamentals of CS and utilized the Java programming language. For a few years, I mostly focused on getting better at Java since it was the first language I learned and pretty much the only language I was using in college. In Sophomore year of college, I started to mess around with HTML, CSS, and Javaccript and that's where my love for web development began. I started using freecodecamp, did lots of their lessons and projects, and even tried to make my own projects. By biggest accomplishment in this field thus far is creating and publishing my own web portfolio that contains all of my programming projects. I am still learning, so currently I am trying to get internships and work on as many programming projects as I can.

I am looking forward to taking this course because I think it will help me hone my skills as a web developer. I have only really messed with node.js so it's exciting to see that we'll be using other Javascript libraries and frameworks. I assume that I will use a lot of the knowledge I gain in future projects and internships. It seems like a lot of this class is applied learning and that's how I learn the best.
